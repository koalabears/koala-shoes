## What is koala-shoes?

koala-shoes is an issues notification board that bundles together the issues that you've raised on other repo's. It highlights new comments that have been made on your issues and allows you to comment further or to close them if you are satisfied that they have been resolved.

## Why do you need it?

koala-shoes keeps you up to date with the repo issues that you've raised on other projects. Remembering all of the issues you have raised can be difficult and so koala-shoes enables you to continue to give feedback on every project you have engaged with which in turn will help to further develop that project :+1:
